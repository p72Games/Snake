  <h1>Leaven in the World</h1>
  <article class="article">
    <h2>Parable and pattern</h2>
    <p>In the parable of the leaven (Matthew 13:33), Jesus compares the kingdom to a woman who hides leaven in dough until the whole batch is leavened. It is a striking image: a tiny, almost invisible beginning that eventually affects the entire lump. The kingdom’s growth is not always dramatic or ostentatious — it often works slowly, beneath the surface, changing structures and habits until outward life reflects inward renewal.</p>

    <h2>Influence, not imposition</h2>
    <p>The leaven image emphasizes influence rather than force. Kingdom activity is persuasive and transformative; it changes taste and temperament, not by coercion but by the persuasive power of love, justice and truth. This means believers are called to be agents of influence: educators, artists, entrepreneurs, caregivers and citizens who live with integrity and compassion.</p>

    <h2>Examples of leavening</h2>
    <p>History shows how small faithful beginnings can become wide movements — schools founded to serve the poor, hospitals started by someone with a burden for the sick, neighborhoods changed by families who stay and serve. These are forms of leavening: long-term, patient efforts that eventually alter the larger culture. The pattern invites Christians to think long-term and act locally.</p>

    <h2>Leaven and the games we play</h2>
    <p>Even in leisure and creativity there is opportunity to leaven culture. Games, stories and art can shape attitudes about fairness, courage, and cooperation. As creators and players, Christians can contribute to cultural goods that reflect truth and beauty. That is part of Dominion’s vision: crafting joyful, wholesome spaces where play also forms character.</p>

    <h2>A hopeful task</h2>
    <p>To embrace the leaven metaphor is to accept patience and persistence. Kingdom work may not bring immediate headlines, but steady acts of love multiply. The encouragement is simple: do the small, faithful thing today; God can use it to leaven the world.</p>
