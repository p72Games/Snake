  <h1>Why Dominion Matters</h1>
  <article class="article">
    <h2>Vision and vocation</h2>
    <p>Dominion Games began as a small experiment: what if playful creativity were paired with a larger vision of faithful influence? The name "Dominion" evokes the biblical call to steward creation responsibly and creatively. In practical terms, that means building games and content that delight players while encouraging virtues like fairness, perseverance and community.</p>

    <h2>Play as formation</h2>
    <p>Games shape habits. Players learn to cooperate, to face setbacks, to persist and to celebrate rightly. If games communicate patterns of greed or hostility, they foster a certain kind of character. Conversely, games that reward fairness, critical thinking, and kindness help form players in healthy ways. Dominion seeks to craft experiences that are fun and formative.</p>

    <h2>Culture by careful craftsmanship</h2>
    <p>Like the shoemaker who quietly bore witness through craft, Dominion wants to show the world a different approach — excellence without showiness, service without self-promotion. The hope is that good work will be noticed and that it will normalize ethical creativity in the digital space.</p>

    <h2>Connecting the sites</h2>
    <p>Your arcade site can work together with a sister content site. Use the sister site to host longer reflections, devotionals, and deeper resources (the place for sustained articles and study). Use Dominion Games as a welcoming gateway — a fun, accessible place that introduces people to ideas and invites them to explore more on the sister site.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Dominion isn’t about dominance in the modern sense; it’s about responsible stewardship, creative excellence, and influence that blesses. Through play, quality craftsmanship, and thoughtful content, it hopes to be a small but steady leaven in culture — an invitation to live well under a greater Lord.</p>
