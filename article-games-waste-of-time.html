  <h1>Are Games a Waste of Time?</h1>

  <p>
    The simple answer to this question is <em>sometimes</em>. Yes, sometimes games can be a waste of time. But this is true of almost anything in life. If you spend all your time eating, it becomes wasteful. If you spend all your time working, even that can become a waste. Every good gift comes from God, but every gift can also be abused when taken out of proportion or pursued without Him.
  </p>

  <p>
    God is for your joy. As John Piper says, <em>“God is more for your joy than you are.”</em> He gave you the ability to play, to enjoy games, and to delight in leisure. That doesn’t mean a grown man with a family should spend hours every day lost in video games — by no means. But it does mean that God created us with the capacity to enjoy recreation, to laugh, to compete, and to celebrate the goodness of His creation.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.”  
    — 1 Corinthians 9:25
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Even the Apostle Paul used the language of sport and competition. He speaks of running the race with endurance, of not “beating the air” aimlessly, but pressing toward a goal. Sport, games, and play were not foreign to him — he used them as metaphors for faith itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    So games are not inherently bad. Rest is good. Play is good. But like every gift, they need to be received with thanksgiving and used wisely.
  </p>

    At Dominion Games, our desire is that games would benefit you. Maybe a simple game of Snake helps you focus while listening to a sermon or podcast. Maybe a trivia game builds up your family in the knowledge of Scripture. Maybe a game of chess teaches your children patience, strategy, and even how to lose with humility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Games can train the mind, strengthen relationships, and even create moments of joy that reflect the delight of our heavenly Father. Used well, they can be part of a life lived for God’s glory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our prayer is that this gift of games would not be abused, but that we would use it — like every good gift — to glorify our Maker, who gave us all things richly to enjoy.
