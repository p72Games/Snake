  <h1>The Ever-Expanding Kingdom</h1>
  <article class="article">
    <h2>Images of growth</h2>
    <p>The Bible uses growth images to describe the kingdom of God. Isaiah speaks of a reign whose increase will know no end (Isaiah 9:7), and Daniel’s visions anticipate a dominion that outlasts empires (Daniel 2:44). Jesus himself used everyday images — mustard seed, leaven, sowing seed — to illustrate how God's rule starts small and expands silently and powerfully.</p>

    <h2>Mustard seed and leaven</h2>
    <p>In the parable of the mustard seed (Matthew 13:31–32), Jesus describes the kingdom as the smallest of seeds that grows into a large tree. In another parable (Matthew 13:33), he compares the kingdom to leaven that a woman hides in dough until it permeates the whole lump. These metaphors describe a type of growth that is organic, pervasive, and often unseen at first. The kingdom expands by increasing the quality and depth of life in people and communities, not merely by numbers.</p>

    <h2>Quiet influence, visible results</h2>
    <p>Kingdom growth often looks quiet and ordinary. A life shaped by Christ's love transforms households, workplaces and neighbourhoods through acts of mercy, truth-telling, and faithful service. Over time, these individual acts accumulate into social change — schools, charities, reforms, and cultural practices that reflect kingdom values. The pattern is not instant revolution but steady renewal that reshapes structures from within.</p>

    <h2>Prophetic promise and present reality</h2>
    <p>Sketches from Daniel and Isaiah remind us that the kingdom is both already and not yet: Christ's reign is present now in the church and in every life that submits to him, but its fullness awaits the future consummation. This tension encourages patient faithfulness: we work for justice, show mercy, and live wisely now, while trusting that the final renewal is secure in Christ.</p>

    <h2>Practical hope</h2>
    <p>For believers, the parables offer a posture of hopefulness — small efforts matter. A friend discipled, a family cared for, a workplace transformed by integrity: these are kingdom seeds. The leaven metaphor urges persistence. Even small acts, faithfully and lovingly done, will compound and shape the wider culture in ways we may never fully see.</p>
