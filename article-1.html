    <h2>The central claim</h2>
    <p>At the heart of Christian confession stands a short, decisive claim: Jesus is Lord. That simple phrase carries cosmic weight. To say "Jesus is Lord" is to place Christ at the center of authority over human life, history, and creation. It is not merely a private religious sentiment; it is a public truth about who rules the universe. The New Testament repeatedly frames Jesus' reign in terms of a kingdom that breaks into history and transforms it from within.</p>

    <h2>Biblical foundations</h2>
    <p>Prophetic images in the Old Testament prepare the way for this reality. Daniel’s visions speak of a kingdom given to the "Son of Man" that will last forever (Daniel 7:13–14). Isaiah prophesies a reign of justice and peace whose increase will have no end (Isaiah 9:6–7). The New Testament authors take up these pictures and apply them to Jesus: his life, death, resurrection and promised return inaugurate the rule of God in a new and decisive way.</p>

    <h2>Lordship in everyday life</h2>
    <p>What does it mean practically that Jesus is Lord of all? It means we evaluate our work, relationships, and priorities by his standard. If Christ is Lord, then no sphere — family, business, art, science, politics, sports or play — is outside his concern. Believers are invited not to withdraw from the world, but to engage it under Christ's rule. This approach reframes vocation: every honest, good work becomes an arena for living under Jesus’ lordship.</p>

    <h2>Not coercion but transformation</h2>
    <p>The kingdom of Christ advances primarily by transformation rather than coercion. Jesus calls people into allegiance through witness and service. His reign is seen in healing, mercy, justice and humble service — signs that point people beyond themselves to the one who brings life and restoration. The spread of the gospel is both personal and social: it renews hearts and, over time, influences culture, institutions and communities.</p>

    <h2>Invitation</h2>
    <p>To confess Jesus as Lord is an invitation to reorder life around him. For the Christian, it is a daily posture of trust, obedience and creativity. For the world, it is a summons to the renewing power of grace. In both cases, the claim "Jesus is Lord" is not a statement to be shelved; it is a reality to be lived.</p>
