<h1>Jesus is Lord of All</h1>

<p>Jesus Christ is not just a figure in history or a character in scripture. He is Lord of all creation, sovereign over heaven and earth. His authority is unchallenged, and His influence spans every aspect of life.</p>

<p>The Bible repeatedly emphasizes that Jesus’ Kingdom is eternal and ever-expanding. In passages like Daniel 2:44 and Isaiah 9:7, we see a Kingdom that cannot be shaken, a dominion that grows beyond human understanding. Like leaven in bread, His influence permeates quietly, yet profoundly, transforming hearts, communities, and cultures.</p>

<p>Believing in Jesus as Lord is not merely about acknowledgement but about letting His influence shape our daily living. Every choice we make, every word we speak, can reflect His values.</p>

<p>Understanding Jesus as Lord of All encourages us to live intentionally. It calls us to live out love, mercy, and justice in practical ways. By embracing His Lordship, our lives become a reflection of His will.</p>
