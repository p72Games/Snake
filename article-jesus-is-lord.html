<h1>Jesus is Lord of All</h1>

<blockquote>
“The earth is the LORD’s and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein.”  
— Psalm 24:1
</blockquote>

<p>
One theme that is clear in all of Scripture is that Jesus is Lord of all. He is King of His temple garden in Genesis, He is the one that divides up the nations, He is the Creator of all—the first, the last, and the one in the middle. With His breath He parts seas and gives life to man. There is not one part of this world that does not belong to Him.
</p>

<p>
Jesus comes into this world declaring the arrival of His Kingdom, a Kingdom Daniel says is without end. The Bible repeatedly emphasizes that Jesus’ Kingdom is eternal and ever-expanding. In passages like Daniel 2:44 and Isaiah 9:7, we see a Kingdom that cannot be shaken, a dominion that grows beyond human understanding. Like leaven in bread, His influence permeates quietly, yet profoundly, transforming hearts, communities, and cultures.

<p>
If Jesus really did come into this world and He really did die and He really did rise again, then surely He is Lord of all—the King of kings. That means that what He says goes. 
</p>

<p>
Believing in Jesus as Lord is not merely about acknowledgement but about letting His influence shape our daily living. Jesus being King has consequences—it is not merely a slogan. Every choice we make, every word we speak, should reflect Him and bring Him glory.
</p>

<p>
Understanding Jesus as Lord of All encourages us to live intentionally. It calls us to live out love, mercy, and justice in practical ways. By embracing His Lordship, our lives become a reflection of His will.
</p>

<p>
This is why even the games we play, the songs we sing, and the food we eat should all be consumed, made, and enjoyed to His glory—forever and ever, amen.
